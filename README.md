- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @franchisefastidious
- ðŸ‘€ This is my place ... to track PC (including Steam Deck) gaming, self-hosting, drugs and other shit I'm interested in.

  Steam deck configs for cracked games, modding, or obscure tidbits related to gaming on the deck
  PC stuff related to gaming, self-hosting, interesting/useful websites, lists of favorite software

  This will contain anything from tips to run games on the deck to hosting various services on PC, tips on growing mushrooms/cannabis or even extracting DMT or mescaline, maybe even how-to find an escort - just whatever I find useful or interesting.  Stuff I don't want to assume I know/remember, and a place to share that information
